# Image-Extractor-from-pdf
To extract information images with a border from a pdf.

This a script that I did when the lecture notes provided by our professor was a pdf with each pages a combination of 4 slides. It was difficult to read the pdf as I had to zoom in each slide each time. This is still in construction stage.
