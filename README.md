# Image-Extractor-from-pdf
To extract information images with a border from a pdf.

This a script that I did when the lecture notes provided by our professor was a pdf with each pages a combination of 4 slides. It was difficult to read the pdf as I had to zoom in each slide each time. This is still in construction stage.

Part 1
Purpose is extract all the 4 slides in a page into 4 images and likewise for all pages and finally making a folder name same as the pdf name and moving all the images into the folder. (The order of the slides should be maintained for continuity.) 

Part 2
In the second part the the script should loop through the different folder containing slides of the particular folder and convert each of them into a ppt with the same folder name.

Pull requests are welcome....
